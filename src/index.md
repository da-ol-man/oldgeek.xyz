Hello. 

If your are like me, then you have limited experience with all things design & development.

This makes getting your business, blog or website online either very difficult or pricey. 

I set out to learn how to build a blog/website for free and along my way I have found ways to do this completely free (except of course the cost of the domain name). I am currently using this free version and as you can see it works great !

All posts and information that you need are on the home page below. No navigation. 

If you need to contact me, head over to the contact page.

There are paid versions of the services I have found. Unless you have bigger needs than I explain, you will not need the paid versions. If you want to use the paid versions, please link from the tools page. The links there are all affiliate links and I would appreciate the support.

Good luck and happy building. 

Wayne
